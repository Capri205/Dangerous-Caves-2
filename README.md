## Information
Adds more mechanics to caves in order to make caving a more interesting but challenging experience.

Plugin contains new custom dangerous monsters, cave aging, ins, new underground structures and more.

More information soon on Wiki page.

If you want to support - just make some cool PRs :D

This project started as a fork of [Dangerous Caves](https://github.com/Evil-Lootlye/dangerous-caves), but it just gone too far, so I decided to detach/defork the original repository from the project.

## Build
Just.. you know.. `mvn clean package`

## Dev-builds
If you can't compile plugin by yourself - just download it from [Actions](https://github.com/imDaniX/Dangerous-Caves-2/actions) tab.
