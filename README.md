# DangerousCaves
Adds more mechanics to caves in order to make caving a more interesting but challenging experience. Also pimps out caves over time and adds ambient sounds while underground.

Plugin contains new custom dangerous monsters, cave aging, ins, new underground structures.

Right now plugin is **absolutely unusable** due to deep development changes. If you want to support - just make some cool PRs :D
### Build
Just.. you know.. `mvn clean package`
